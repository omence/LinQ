# LinQ
What is the purpose of the program?

To query a JSON fole to get desired information.

I created a a method that gets all neighborhoods from JSON file.

Then I wrote a method that filters out empty space.

Then I wrote a method that filtered out duplicates.

Finally I rewrote the no spaces method in LAMBDA style.

What does the program look like? (visual)
